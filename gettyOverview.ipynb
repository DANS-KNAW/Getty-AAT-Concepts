    "The [**Getty Arts & Architecture Thesaurus**](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/) is a multilingual, semantically structured **controlled vocabulary**. It encompases terms, descriptions, and other information for generic concepts related to visual art, architecture, archaeology, and other cultural heritage. Importantly, the AAT contains generic terms, not iconographic subjects or proper names. In other words: [\"each concept is a case of many (a generic thing), not a case of one (a specific thing)\"](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/about.html#purpose). The full AAT database contains around 74,460 concept records (subject_id) and 503,230 terms (term_id). Each concept record contains one or more terms (e.g., singular/plural forms, spelling variations, translations). A record minimally contains a unique numeric id, a term, and an indication for the position in the structured hierarchy. Often it also contains a description of the term, a list of associated or equivalent terms and temporal information. The AAT is translated to Dutch by the Netherlands Institute for Art History. Note that the AAT is a compiled resource, so it's not a complete, definitive collection of concepts. It expands through community [contributions](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/contributors.html) by domain experts. \n"

    "- Curation per facet: establish a path to a layer that yields keyword at the desired level of granularity for each facet. For example, in the *Associated concepts* facet, the [leaf nodes](https://www.getty.edu/vow/AATHierarchy?find=beauty&logic=AND&note=&subjectid=300055938) generally seem useful terms to function as keywords, whereas the hierarchy names are quite generic. In contrast, in the *Physical attribute* facet, some of the [leaf nodes](https://www.getty.edu/vow/AATHierarchy?find=beauty&logic=AND&note=&subjectid=300185404) seem too specific to be useful keywords (e.g. *halation, oxidative-reductive deterioration*). \n",
    "- Some facets may be excluded entirely (e.g. *Brand Names*, possibly *Activities*)"
