    "The **Getty Arts & Architecture Thesaurus** is a multilingual, semantically structured vocabulary. It encompases terms, descriptions, and other information for generic concepts related to art, architecture, archaeology, and other cultural heritage ([Cobb, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1080/19386389.2015.1103081)). Importantly, the AAT contains generic terms, not iconographic subjects or proper names. In other words: [\"each concept is a case of many (a generic thing), not a case of one (a specific thing)\"](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/about.html)\n",
