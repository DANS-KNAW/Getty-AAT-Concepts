    "The [**Getty Arts & Architecture Thesaurus**](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/) is a multilingual, semantically structured **controlled vocabulary**. It encompases terms, descriptions, and other information for generic concepts related to visual art, architecture, archaeology, and other cultural heritage. Importantly, the AAT contains generic terms, not iconographic subjects or proper names. In other words: [\"each concept is a case of many (a generic thing), not a case of one (a specific thing)\"](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/about.html#purpose). The full AAT database contains around 74,460 concept records (subject_id) and 503,230 terms (term_id). Each concept record contains one or more terms (e.g., singular/plural forms, spelling variations, translations). A record minimally contains a unique numeric id, a term, and an indication for the position in the structured hierarchy. Often it also contains a description of the term, a list of associated or equivalent terms and temporal information. The AAT is translated to Dutch by the Netherlands Institute for Art History. Note that the AAT is a compiled resource, so it's not a complete, definitive collection of concepts. It expands through community [contributions](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/contributors.html) by domain experts. \n"

    "The AAT is one example of the vocabularies that are developed by the Getty Institute. There's [more](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/index.html), for example the Union List of Artist Names (ULAN). It contains records for artists and agents in the cultural landscape, specifically the visual arts. This includes [names, relationships, and biographical information for makers and other people and corporate bodies](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/about.html#scope).\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the AAT, the ULAN consists or *records*, in this case referring to a unique person, institute or corporation. A record can contain mutliple *terms* that may capture [given names, pseudonyms, variant spellings, names in multiple languages, and names that have changed over time](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/about.html#scope). A minimal record contains the following fields: record type, name, name source, display biography, nationality, role, birth date and death date. \n",

    "\n",
    "- `PERSONS, ARTIST` Facet: represents information about individuals involved in the creation or production of works of art or architecture (e.g., *Rembrandt van Rijn*)\n",
    "- `CORPORATE BODIES` Facet: represents information about corporate bodies, defined as two or more people working together to create or produce art or architecture (e.g., *Adler and Sullivan*)\n",
    "- `NON-ARTISTS` Facet: mostly represents patrons, who often had input in the creative process, and occasionally donors, sitters, and others whose names are required for indexing visual works but who are themselves not artists.  \n",
    "- `UNKNOWN PEOPLE BY CULTURE` Facet: refers to the generic culture in which a work was created (e.g. *unknown Aztec*, or simply *Aztec*)\n",

    "  - **Size**: the AAT contains more than 70.000 records that all refer to unique concepts. If we would use the Dutch terms for each concept, it would mean we have 50.000 keywords to choose from. Many of these terms may be topically irrelevant, too specific or too broad for our purposes. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations \n",
    "- Curation per facet: establish a path to a layer that yields keyword at the desired level of granularity for each facet. For example, in the *Associated concepts* facet, the [leaf nodes](https://www.getty.edu/vow/AATHierarchy?find=beauty&logic=AND&note=&subjectid=300055938) generally seem useful terms to function as keywords, whereas the hierarchy names are quite generic. In contrast, in the *Physical attribute* facet, some of the [leaf nodes](https://www.getty.edu/vow/AATHierarchy?find=beauty&logic=AND&note=&subjectid=300185404) seem too specific to be useful keywords (e.g. *halation, oxidative-reductive deterioration*). \n",
